# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix CosmosDB SQL Aggregation for Sentiment Statistics

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 20, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: The specification describes what needs to be fixed (SQL aggregation) without specifying how to implement it (e.g., no mention of specific query patterns, database libraries, or code structure).

✅ **User value focused**: Each user story explains the value to API consumers, dashboard users, and analysts rather than technical implementation details.

✅ **Non-technical language**: Written in plain language that business stakeholders can understand. Technical terms (CosmosDB, SQL) are necessary context but explained in user-impact terms.

✅ **All sections completed**: User Scenarios, Requirements, and Success Criteria sections are fully populated with concrete details.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No clarification needed**: All requirements are specific and unambiguous. The issue description provides complete context about the problem and expected behavior.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified through API calls, database queries, or integration tests. Example: FR-004 can be tested by comparing API responses to actual database contents.

✅ **Measurable success criteria**:

- SC-001: Verifiable through comparison testing (100% accuracy requirement)
- SC-002: Measured via API response time (< 2 seconds)
- SC-003: Verified through spot-checks and automated tests
- SC-004: Verified by test suite (zero SQL errors)
- SC-005: Verified by edge case test coverage

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria focus on outcomes (accurate data, performance, correctness) without mentioning specific database queries, programming patterns, or implementation approaches.

✅ **Complete acceptance scenarios**: Each user story has 3 specific Given-When-Then scenarios covering normal operation, data variations, and edge cases.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: Four edge cases documented covering null values, missing data, invalid parameters, and empty result sets.

✅ **Clear scope**: The feature is bounded to fixing the `get_sentiment_stats()` aggregation. Does not expand into other database methods or new features.

✅ **Dependencies clear**: Related to Feature #004 (datetime fix) which is already complete. No blocking dependencies.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Requirements have acceptance criteria**: All 10 functional requirements are testable through the acceptance scenarios in the user stories.

✅ **User scenarios complete**: Three prioritized user stories cover the full scope from basic API functionality (P1) to UI integration (P2) to time-based analysis (P3).

✅ **Measurable outcomes**: Five success criteria provide clear, quantifiable targets for validating the fix.

✅ **Implementation-free**: The spec describes the problem (SQL syntax error) and required outcomes (accurate statistics) without prescribing specific query approaches or code patterns.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or direct implementation
- Issue #15 provides comprehensive technical context that can be referenced during implementation
- The recommended solution approach (separate COUNT queries) is mentioned in the issue but intentionally kept out of this spec to maintain implementation independence
