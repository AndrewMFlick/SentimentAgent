# Specification Quality Checklist: Enhanced Hot Topics with Tool Insights

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (2 found - see clarification section below)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
- [x] All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers resolved

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Clarifications Resolved

### Question 1: Related Posts Default Sort Order

**Context**: From User Story 2, Acceptance Scenario 5

**Question**: What is the default sort order for displaying related posts when viewing a hot topic?

**Answer Selected**: Sort by engagement (most comments/upvotes first), with timeline filtering that excludes posts without engagement within the selected time range (24 hours, 7 days, etc.)

**Implications**: 
- Users see the most popular/discussed posts
- Requires Reddit API access to upvote/comment counts
- Engagement must be tracked with timestamps to support timeline filtering
- Posts without recent engagement are filtered out based on the selected time range

### Question 2: Related Posts Display Limit

**Context**: From Functional Requirement FR-012

**Question**: How should the system limit the number of related posts displayed?

**Answer Selected**: Option B - Show 20 posts initially with "Load More" button

**Implications**:
- Initial page load is fast with only 20 posts
- Users can explore deeper without pagination UI complexity
- Backend needs to track cursor/offset for fetching next batch
- "Load More" button appears only when more posts are available

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass:

- Content Quality: 5/5 ✅
- Requirement Completeness: 9/9 ✅
- Feature Readiness: 4/4 ✅

All clarifications resolved - Specification is complete and ready for decomposition into tasks
**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| A | Fixed limit of 20 posts (no pagination) | Simple UX, fast loading. Users see top 20 posts only. May miss important posts if more than 20 exist. |
| B | Show 20 initially with "Load More" button | Progressive disclosure, good UX balance. Users can choose to see more. Requires tracking loaded state. |
| C | Full pagination (e.g., 20 per page with page numbers) | Traditional navigation, good for large datasets. More complex UI. Users can jump to specific pages. |
| Custom | Provide your own answer | Specify a different approach (e.g., infinite scroll, different initial limit, collapsible sections) |

**Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_

## Notes

- Spec is well-structured with clear user stories prioritized by value
- Assumptions section provides good defaults for unspecified details
- Dependencies and out-of-scope items clearly documented
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases cover important scenarios
- **Action Required**: Resolve 2 clarification questions above before proceeding to `/speckit.plan`
