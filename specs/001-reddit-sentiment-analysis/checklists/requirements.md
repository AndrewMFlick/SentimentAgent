# Specification Quality Checklist: Reddit Sentiment Analysis for AI Developer Tools

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-13  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Iteration 1: Initial Validation

**Status**: Requires clarification on 2 items

**Issues Found**:

1. **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION] in FR-023**: Data retention period not specified
   - Location: Requirements section, FR-023
   - Impact: Affects storage costs, query performance, and compliance requirements

2. **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION] in Business Constraints**: LLM API budget allocation not specified
   - Location: Dependencies & Constraints section
   - Impact: Determines whether LLM analysis is viable for all posts or only selective use

**Items Passing**: All other checklist items pass validation. The specification is well-structured, focused on user value, and avoids implementation details throughout.

### Iteration 2: Final Validation

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All items pass

**Clarifications Resolved**:

1. **Data Retention (FR-023)**: Set to 90 days (3 months)
   - Provides moderate storage costs and covers quarterly trends
   - Good balance for most use cases
   - Enables seasonal pattern detection

2. **LLM Budget Strategy (Business Constraints)**: Start with VADER, evaluate LLM later
   - Deploy with VADER initially to establish baseline
   - Gather data on volume and cost projections
   - Conservative approach for budget planning
   - Allows informed decision on LLM adoption after real-world data collection

**Final Assessment**: All quality criteria met. Specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

## Notes

- ✅ All clarifications resolved
- ✅ Specification ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- Recommendation: Proceed with `/speckit.plan` to begin implementation planning
- Conservative LLM strategy allows for cost-effective initial deployment with upgrade path
