# Feature Specification: Reddit Sentiment Analysis for AI Developer Tools

**Feature Branch**: `001-reddit-sentiment-analysis`  
**Created**: 2025-10-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a sentiment analysis app that should be able to scale, will be hosted in Azure. It will provide sentiment analysis for reddit on AI Developer tools, it should query for updates every 30 min and run live sentiment analysis. It should use the PRAW libraries. I'd like options for whether to use VADER for sentiment analysis or to potentially use an LLM. These are the subreddits: Cursor,Bard,GithubCopilot,claude,windsurf,ChatGPTCoding,vibecoding,aws,programming,MachineLearning,artificial,OpenAI,kiroIDE,JulesAgent. I'd like a sentiment dashboard that provides sentiment over time. I'd like a hot topics page as well that brings front and center trending topics. I'd also like an AI Agent that I can query with questions about topics like what is driving sentiment change in a given tool or to compare sentiment across multiple tools."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Real-Time Sentiment Monitoring (Priority: P1)

As a product manager tracking AI developer tools, I need to see current sentiment trends across multiple tools so that I can understand how the community perceives different solutions and track changes over time.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - providing automated sentiment analysis of Reddit discussions about AI developer tools. Without this, the application has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that the system continuously monitors the specified subreddits, analyzes sentiment of posts and comments every 30 minutes, and displays current sentiment scores on a dashboard. Delivers immediate value by showing real-time sentiment data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the system is running, **When** 30 minutes have elapsed since the last data collection, **Then** the system automatically queries all 14 configured subreddits for new posts and comments
2. **Given** new Reddit content has been collected, **When** sentiment analysis is performed, **Then** each post and comment receives a sentiment score (positive, negative, neutral) with confidence level
3. **Given** sentiment analysis is complete, **When** a user views the dashboard, **Then** they see current sentiment scores for each AI tool with timestamp of last update
4. **Given** multiple data collection cycles have run, **When** a user views the dashboard, **Then** they see sentiment trends over time (hourly, daily, weekly views)

### User Story 2 - Trending Topics Discovery (Priority: P2)

As a developer relations specialist, I need to identify trending topics and discussions across AI developer tool communities so that I can understand what issues, features, or concerns are currently generating the most engagement.

**Why this priority**: This adds analytical depth beyond raw sentiment scores, helping users understand *what* is driving sentiment and community engagement. It's the second most valuable feature for understanding community dynamics.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that the system identifies posts with high engagement (upvotes, comments) and rapid activity growth, categorizes them by topic, and displays them on a dedicated trending page. Delivers value by surfacing important discussions without manual searching.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** sentiment data has been collected, **When** the trending algorithm runs, **Then** posts are ranked by engagement velocity (rate of upvotes and comments over time)
2. **Given** trending posts have been identified, **When** a user accesses the hot topics page, **Then** they see the top 20 trending posts across all monitored subreddits
3. **Given** a trending post is displayed, **When** a user views the details, **Then** they see the post title, subreddit, engagement metrics, sentiment score, and key discussion themes
4. **Given** trending topics have been analyzed, **When** topics are grouped by theme, **Then** related discussions about similar features or issues are clustered together

### User Story 3 - Interactive AI Analysis Agent (Priority: P3)

As an analyst researching AI developer tools, I need to query an AI agent with natural language questions about sentiment patterns so that I can get insights like "What's driving negative sentiment for Cursor?" or "Compare sentiment trends between GitHub Copilot and Claude" without manually analyzing data.

**Why this priority**: This provides the most advanced analytical capability but requires the core sentiment data (P1) and trending analysis (P2) to be valuable. It's the natural evolution of the platform from data display to intelligent insights.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting natural language queries to the AI agent and verifying that it returns accurate, data-driven answers based on the collected sentiment data and trending topics. Delivers value by providing instant analytical insights.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** sentiment data is available, **When** a user asks "What is driving sentiment change in [tool name]?", **Then** the agent analyzes recent posts, identifies key themes in positive/negative discussions, and presents a summary with examples
2. **Given** sentiment data for multiple tools exists, **When** a user asks "Compare sentiment across [tool1] and [tool2]", **Then** the agent provides comparative sentiment scores, trend directions, and key differentiating discussion topics
3. **Given** a user asks a question, **When** the agent responds, **Then** the response includes specific data points (sentiment scores, date ranges, example posts) supporting the analysis
4. **Given** trending topics have been identified, **When** a user asks "What are people discussing about [topic]?", **Then** the agent summarizes the discussion themes and sentiment breakdown

---

### User Story 4 - Sentiment Analysis Engine Configuration (Priority: P2)

As a system administrator, I need to configure the sentiment analysis method (VADER or LLM-based) so that I can optimize for either speed/cost (VADER) or accuracy/nuance (LLM) based on operational requirements.

**Why this priority**: This provides operational flexibility and allows the system to scale based on budget and accuracy requirements. It's critical for production deployment but doesn't affect end-user value directly.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by switching between VADER and LLM analysis methods via configuration, processing the same batch of Reddit posts, and verifying that both methods produce sentiment scores and that the system continues operating normally. Delivers value by enabling cost/accuracy trade-offs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the system is configured to use VADER, **When** sentiment analysis runs, **Then** posts are analyzed using VADER sentiment intensity analyzer and results are stored with method="VADER"
2. **Given** the system is configured to use LLM, **When** sentiment analysis runs, **Then** posts are analyzed using LLM API calls and results are stored with method="LLM"
3. **Given** the sentiment method is changed, **When** the next collection cycle runs, **Then** new data uses the updated method without system restart
4. **Given** both methods have been used over time, **When** viewing historical data, **Then** the dashboard indicates which analysis method was used for each time period

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

- Reddit API access is available and stable for continuous data collection
- Cloud infrastructure provides sufficient compute and storage resources for scaling
- Users accessing the dashboard have modern web browsers with JavaScript enabled
- Reddit rate limits (60 requests per minute for OAuth authenticated apps) are sufficient for 30-minute collection cycles across 14 subreddits
- English is the primary language for sentiment analysis; non-English posts will be flagged but may not be analyzed accurately
- LLM API (when selected) has sufficient rate limits and availability for real-time sentiment analysis
- Users have basic familiarity with the AI developer tools being monitored
- Sentiment analysis focuses on public posts and comments; private messages and deleted content are excluded

## Out of Scope *(mandatory)*

- User authentication and authorization (initial version will be internal/admin-only access)
- Multi-language sentiment analysis beyond English
- Real-time alerting or notifications for sentiment changes
- Integration with other social media platforms (Twitter, Discord, Stack Overflow)
- Automated sentiment-based trading or investment decisions
- Direct integration with AI tool vendor APIs or databases
- User-contributed sentiment labels or corrections to model output
- Historical data import from before system deployment
- Sentiment analysis of images, videos, or other non-text content
- Custom subreddit configuration by end users (subreddit list is fixed in initial version)

## Dependencies & Constraints *(optional)*

### External Dependencies

- **Reddit API**: System depends on Reddit's API availability and rate limits; extended outages will prevent data collection
- **LLM API**: If LLM-based sentiment analysis is selected, requires API access with sufficient rate limits and budget allocation
- **Cloud Services**: Requires cloud subscription with appropriate service limits for compute, storage, and networking

### Technical Constraints

- Data collection interval is fixed at 30 minutes to balance timeliness with API rate limit compliance
- Subreddit list is hard-coded in initial version; adding/removing subreddits requires configuration update and deployment
- Historical trend analysis is limited by data retention period
- AI agent query complexity is constrained by LLM context window size and processing time limits

### Business Constraints

- System will initially deploy with VADER sentiment analysis; LLM adoption will be evaluated after gathering data on volume and cost projections
- System must comply with Reddit's API Terms of Service and rate limiting policies
- Data storage and retention must comply with applicable data privacy regulations

## Risks *(optional)*

- **High Risk**: Reddit API changes or rate limit reductions could disrupt data collection
  - Mitigation: Implement robust error handling and consider data collection frequency adjustment options
- **Medium Risk**: Sentiment analysis accuracy may be insufficient for nuanced technical discussions
  - Mitigation: Provide configuration to switch between VADER and LLM; allow manual review of edge cases
- **Medium Risk**: High-volume subreddits (programming, MachineLearning) may generate more data than system can process in 30-minute windows
  - Mitigation: Design for horizontal scaling; implement sampling strategies if needed
- **Low Risk**: AI agent may provide misleading insights if underlying sentiment data has quality issues
  - Mitigation: Include confidence indicators and data source references in agent responses

## Notes *(optional)*

- Initial deployment should focus on P1 (core sentiment monitoring) to validate data collection and analysis pipeline before building advanced features
- Consider starting with VADER for cost-effective baseline, then selectively applying LLM to posts flagged as high-impact or ambiguous
- Dashboard design should prioritize clarity and quick insight discovery over complex visualizations
- AI agent should be designed with extensibility in mind for future query types (e.g., predictive analysis, anomaly detection)
