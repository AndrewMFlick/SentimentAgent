# Feature Specification: Fix CosmosDB DateTime Query Format

**Feature Branch**: `004-fix-the-cosmosdb`  
**Created**: 2025-10-17  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Fix the CosmosDB DateTime Query Format"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Backend Startup Data Loading (Priority: P1)

When the backend application starts up, it needs to load recent data from CosmosDB to warm up caches and provide immediate data availability to API consumers. Currently, this data loading fails due to datetime format incompatibility between the Python application and CosmosDB's PostgreSQL mode emulator.

**Why this priority**: This is blocking a critical P1 user story (#003) for startup data loading. Without this fix, the backend starts with empty caches, causing slow initial response times and degraded user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting the backend application and verifying that the `load_recent_data()` method successfully queries and loads posts, comments, and sentiment data from the last 24 hours without errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the backend is starting up and CosmosDB contains data from the past 24 hours, **When** the `load_recent_data()` method executes, **Then** it successfully queries and loads all recent posts, comments, and sentiment data without throwing InternalServerError exceptions
2. **Given** a database query includes a datetime filter parameter, **When** the query is executed against CosmosDB PostgreSQL mode, **Then** the datetime parameter is properly formatted and accepted by the database engine
3. **Given** the application logs startup events, **When** data loading completes successfully, **Then** the logs show actual counts of loaded data (e.g., "100 posts, 250 comments") instead of "Data loading temporarily disabled"

### User Story 2 - Historical Data Queries (Priority: P2)

Users and background jobs need to query historical data based on time ranges (e.g., "get posts from the last 24 hours", "get sentiment stats from last week"). These queries currently fail when datetime parameters are used.

**Why this priority**: This affects multiple API endpoints and scheduled jobs that rely on time-based queries, including trending topic analysis, data cleanup jobs, and historical sentiment reporting.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by calling any API endpoint that accepts time range parameters (e.g., `/api/v1/posts?hours=24`) and verifying that results are returned without database errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a request to get posts from the last N hours, **When** `get_recent_posts(hours=24)` is called, **Then** it returns all posts collected within that timeframe without query errors
2. **Given** a request to get sentiment statistics for a time range, **When** `get_sentiment_stats(hours=168)` is called, **Then** it returns aggregated statistics for the past week without InternalServerError
3. **Given** the cleanup job runs on schedule, **When** `cleanup_old_data()` executes to remove data older than the retention period, **Then** it successfully queries and deletes old records without datetime format errors

### User Story 3 - Data Collection and Analysis Jobs (Priority: P2)

Scheduled background jobs collect Reddit data, analyze sentiment, and identify trending topics. These jobs need to check for existing data and avoid duplicates by querying based on timestamps.

**Why this priority**: While jobs can still collect new data, they cannot efficiently check for duplicates or incremental updates, leading to potential data duplication and wasted API quota.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering a data collection job manually and verifying that it can query existing posts by timestamp to avoid re-collecting the same data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a scheduled collection job is about to collect new posts, **When** it queries for existing posts from the same time period, **Then** it successfully retrieves existing posts to check for duplicates
2. **Given** the trending topics analyzer needs recent data, **When** it queries for posts and comments from the analysis window, **Then** it receives all relevant data without query failures
