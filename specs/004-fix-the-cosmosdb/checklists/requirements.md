- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Summary**: All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for planning.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear problem statement with specific error details
- Well-defined success criteria with measurable outcomes
- Three prioritized user stories covering all affected use cases
- Comprehensive edge case analysis
- Detailed context about current vs. desired behavior
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions

**Minor Issues** (non-blocking):
- Some markdown linting issues (trailing spaces, bare URLs) - cosmetic only
- References section uses bare URLs instead of markdown links - acceptable for documentation

**Readiness**: âœ… READY FOR PLANNING - Proceed with `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` if additional details are needed.
