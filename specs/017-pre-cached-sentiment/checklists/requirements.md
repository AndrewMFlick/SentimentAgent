# Specification Quality Checklist

**Feature**: 017-pre-cached-sentiment  
**Generated**: October 27, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ VALIDATED

## ✅ User Scenarios & Testing

- [x] **User stories are prioritized** (P1, P2, P3 assigned)
  - P1: View Current Tool Sentiment (core functionality)
  - P2: Automatic Cache Refresh (essential for accuracy)
  - P3: View Historical Trends (analytical value)
  
- [x] **Each story is independently testable**
  - P1: Test by navigating to dashboard and verifying <1s response
  - P2: Test by monitoring cache refresh jobs
  - P3: Test by selecting time ranges and verifying performance
  
- [x] **Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format**
  - All 3 user stories have proper GWT scenarios
  - Each scenario is specific and measurable
  
- [x] **Edge cases are documented**
  - Cache refresh failures
  - Cold start scenarios
  - Custom date ranges
  - Cache invalidation
  - Storage issues

## ✅ Requirements

- [x] **All functional requirements are testable**
  - FR-001 to FR-010 all have clear success conditions
  - No vague requirements like "should improve performance"
  
- [x] **Requirements use MUST, SHOULD, or MAY appropriately**
  - All 10 functional requirements use "MUST" (required functionality)
  
- [x] **No implementation details specified**
  - ✅ No database schema specified
  - ✅ No API endpoints defined
  - ✅ No code structure prescribed
  - ✅ No technology choices mandated
  
- [x] **Key entities identified (if applicable)**
  - Sentiment Cache Entry: clearly defined attributes
  - Cache Metadata: monitoring and health tracking
  
- [x] **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**
  - All requirements are complete and clear

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [x] **All criteria are measurable**
  - SC-001: <1 second response time (measurable)
  - SC-002: 95% cache hit rate (measurable)
  - SC-003: 15-minute refresh interval (measurable)
  - SC-004: <2 second load time for 30-day trends (measurable)
  - SC-005: >90% cache hit rate (measurable)
  - SC-006: Data freshness visible in <5 seconds (measurable)
  - SC-007: >99% cache availability (measurable)
  
- [x] **Criteria are user-focused (not technical)**
  - All criteria describe user experience or system behavior
  - No technical metrics like "database queries optimized"
  
- [x] **Success criteria align with user stories**
  - SC-001, SC-002, SC-004, SC-005: Support P1 (fast queries)
  - SC-003: Supports P2 (automatic refresh)
  - SC-006, SC-007: Support user confidence and reliability

## ✅ Additional Checks

- [x] **Assumptions are documented**
  - 15-minute cache acceptable for 30-day data
  - Users tolerate slightly stale data
  - Cache storage manageable
  - Standard time periods most common
  - Performance issue is query size, not server capacity
  
- [x] **Dependencies are identified**
  - Existing sentiment pipeline
  - Scheduled job system
  - Database time-range query support
  - Storage capacity
  
- [x] **Scope is clearly defined**
  - In Scope: 6 clear items
  - Out of Scope: 6 clear exclusions (no real-time, no custom ranges, etc.)
  
- [x] **No contradictions between sections**
  - Requirements align with user stories
  - Success criteria match requirements
  - Scope excludes what's not in requirements

## Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING PHASE**

**Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization with rationale
- All requirements are testable and measurable
- No implementation details specified
- Comprehensive edge cases documented
- Success criteria are user-focused and specific
- Scope clearly defines boundaries

**Recommendations**:
- None - specification is complete and meets all quality standards
- Ready to proceed with `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` as needed

**Next Steps**:
1. Review specification with stakeholders
2. Proceed to planning phase if approved
3. Begin implementation planning with clear requirements
