# Feature Specification: Backend Stability and Data Loading

**Feature Branch**: `003-backend-stability-and-data-loading`  
**Created**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The backend is unstable and keeps crashing. Any data that is loaded previously into the database doesn't immediately show up on application startup. With a crashed backend this means no data from prior days, current days, and no data showing."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Backend Remains Stable During Data Collection (Priority: P1)

As a system operator, I need the backend server to remain running continuously without crashes during and after Reddit data collection cycles, so that the API remains available to serve frontend requests at all times.

**Why this priority**: Critical production issue - the system is currently unusable because the backend crashes, leaving no API available for the frontend. This is the highest priority blocker.

**Independent Test**: Start the backend, trigger a data collection cycle, and verify the backend process remains running for at least 1 hour after collection completes. Monitor process health and memory usage throughout.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the backend starts successfully, **When** the initial 5-second delayed collection executes, **Then** the backend process continues running without crashes
2. **Given** a scheduled 30-minute collection cycle runs, **When** 700 posts and 4000+ comments are collected and saved, **Then** the backend remains responsive and doesn't terminate
3. **Given** the backend has been running for 2 hours with 3 collection cycles, **When** checking the process status, **Then** the same process is still running (not restarted)
4. **Given** an error occurs during collection (Reddit API timeout), **When** the error is handled, **Then** the backend logs the error and continues running
5. **Given** uvicorn is running in reload mode, **When** code changes are detected, **Then** the reload happens gracefully without orphaned processes

### User Story 2 - Previously Collected Data Loads on Startup (Priority: P1)

As a dashboard user, I need to see existing data from the database immediately when I access the application, even if no new collection has run yet, so that I can view historical sentiment analysis without waiting.

**Why this priority**: Users cannot see any data currently because even though data exists in the database, it's not being loaded on startup. This makes the application appear broken even when data exists.

**Independent Test**: Ensure database contains data from previous collections, restart the backend, immediately query the API, and verify historical data is returned without waiting for new collection.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the database contains 700 posts collected yesterday, **When** the backend starts and health check passes, **Then** GET /sentiment/stats returns non-zero counts immediately
2. **Given** posts were collected 3 hours ago, **When** querying /posts/recent?hours=24, **Then** those posts are returned in the response
3. **Given** sentiment scores exist in the database, **When** the dashboard loads, **Then** sentiment distribution charts display existing data within 2 seconds
4. **Given** trending topics were analyzed yesterday, **When** GET /trending is called after startup, **Then** yesterday's trending topics are returned
5. **Given** the backend restarts while data exists, **When** the frontend refreshes, **Then** users see data immediately without a "no data" state

---

### User Story 3 - Real-time Data Query Performance (Priority: P2)

As a dashboard user, I need API queries to return results quickly even with large datasets in the database, so that the user interface remains responsive as data accumulates over time.

**Why this priority**: As data grows (multiple collection cycles per day for 90 days = millions of records), query performance becomes critical. This prevents future performance degradation.

**Independent Test**: Load database with 30 days of data (21,000 posts, 120,000+ comments), query various endpoints, and verify all respond within performance thresholds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the database contains 30 days of data, **When** GET /sentiment/stats is called, **Then** the response is returned within 3 seconds
2. **Given** 100,000+ sentiment scores exist, **When** filtering by specific subreddit, **Then** the query uses indexes and returns within 2 seconds
3. **Given** trending analysis runs on 7 days of data, **When** GET /trending is called, **Then** results are returned within 5 seconds
4. **Given** the database contains 90 days of data (maximum retention), **When** queries use time window filters, **Then** only relevant data is scanned (confirmed via query metrics)
5. **Given** multiple concurrent dashboard users, **When** 20 users query simultaneously, **Then** all queries complete within 5 seconds

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the backend crashes mid-collection? Data should be partially saved (already inserted records remain), and next collection should resume normally
- How does the system handle CosmosDB connection failures during startup? Should retry with exponential backoff and eventually start in degraded mode
- What happens when data retention cleanup runs on 90-day-old data? Should not impact active queries or cause performance spikes
- How does the system behave when uvicorn reload triggers during active API requests? In-flight requests should complete, new requests queue gracefully
- What happens when the database returns no results for a valid time window? API should return empty arrays/zero counts, not errors

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Backend process MUST remain running continuously for at least 24 hours without crashes or unexpected terminations
- **FR-002**: Backend MUST load and serve existing database data immediately upon startup completion (within 10 seconds)
- **FR-003**: Backend MUST handle data collection errors gracefully without terminating the process
- **FR-004**: Backend MUST log all errors with sufficient context for debugging (timestamp, stack trace, request context)
- **FR-005**: Database queries MUST use appropriate indexes on timestamp and subreddit fields for efficient filtering
- **FR-006**: API endpoints MUST return existing data even when no collection has run in the current session
- **FR-007**: Backend MUST implement proper shutdown handling to clean up resources (ThreadPoolExecutor, scheduler, database connections)
- **FR-008**: Backend MUST detect and prevent orphaned processes when uvicorn reload triggers
- **FR-009**: CosmosDB connection MUST implement retry logic with exponential backoff on transient failures
- **FR-010**: Backend MUST expose process health metrics (uptime, memory usage, collection cycle count, error count)

### Performance Requirements

- **PR-001**: Startup time from process start to health endpoint responding MUST be under 15 seconds
- **PR-002**: GET /sentiment/stats MUST respond within 3 seconds with 30 days of data in database
- **PR-003**: GET /posts/recent MUST respond within 2 seconds for any valid time window
- **PR-004**: GET /trending MUST respond within 5 seconds when analyzing 7 days of data
- **PR-005**: Backend memory usage MUST remain under 512MB during normal operation
- **PR-006**: Backend MUST handle 50 concurrent API requests without degradation

### Key Entities

- **BackendProcess**: Represents the running FastAPI/uvicorn process, tracks uptime, restart count, crash events, resource usage metrics
- **DatabaseConnection**: Manages CosmosDB client lifecycle, implements retry logic, tracks connection health and query performance
- **CollectionCycle**: Enhanced to track lifecycle state (initializing, collecting, saving, complete, failed) and persist state to allow recovery
- **HealthCheck**: Extended endpoint that returns process metrics, database connection status, last successful collection timestamp, memory/CPU usage

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Backend process runs continuously for 24 hours without crashes (0 unexpected terminations)
