# Specification Quality Checklist: Asynchronous Data Collection

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 14, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - Specification is complete and ready for planning

### Validation Details

**Content Quality Assessment**:

- ✅ Specification focuses on performance and responsiveness outcomes, not implementation
- ✅ No mention of specific frameworks, libraries, or code structures
- ✅ Written from user and administrator perspectives
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness Assessment**:

- ✅ No clarification markers - all requirements are specific and actionable
- ✅ Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-002 specifies "under 3 seconds")
- ✅ Success criteria include quantifiable metrics (1 second response, 100% uptime, 50 concurrent requests)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation (e.g., "API responds within X seconds" not "thread pool handles requests")
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format and are specific
- ✅ Edge cases cover error scenarios, concurrent load, and API failures
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded to asynchronous collection without changing functionality
- ✅ No external dependencies identified (internal performance optimization)

**Feature Readiness Assessment**:

- ✅ FR-001 through FR-010 each have measurable outcomes in SC-001 through SC-007
- ✅ Three prioritized user stories (P1: API responsiveness, P2: Collection completion, P3: Startup speed)
- ✅ Success criteria define concrete targets: 1s health check, 3s dashboard load, 100% collection success
- ✅ Specification maintains technology-agnostic language throughout

## Notes

- Feature addresses a critical production issue (blocking I/O during data collection)
- Specification correctly focuses on observable behavior (response times, availability) rather than implementation approach
- Well-defined success criteria provide clear targets for validation testing
- Edge cases appropriately cover failure scenarios and high-load conditions
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning
