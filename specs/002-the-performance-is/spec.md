# Feature Specification: Asynchronous Data Collection

**Feature Branch**: `002-the-performance-is`  
**Created**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The performance is slow or blocking due to PRAW. The fix would be to implement this asynchronous for data collection."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - API Remains Responsive During Data Collection (Priority: P1)

As a dashboard user, I need the API endpoints to respond immediately even while Reddit data collection is running in the background, so I can view sentiment analysis results without experiencing delays or timeouts.

**Why this priority**: This is the most critical issue - the system is currently unusable during data collection periods. Users cannot access the dashboard or API when collection runs, making the application unreliable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering data collection and immediately making API requests to /health, /sentiment/stats, and /posts/recent endpoints. All should respond within 2 seconds regardless of collection status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** data collection is actively running, **When** a user requests the health endpoint, **Then** the response is returned within 2 seconds
2. **Given** data collection is processing 1000+ Reddit posts, **When** a user accesses the dashboard, **Then** the page loads and displays current data within 3 seconds
3. **Given** multiple API requests are made concurrently, **When** data collection is running, **Then** all requests complete without blocking or timeout errors

### User Story 2 - Data Collection Completes Without Blocking (Priority: P2)

As a system administrator, I need Reddit data collection to run in the background without freezing the application, so that scheduled collection cycles complete successfully while maintaining service availability.

**Why this priority**: Essential for operational reliability - collection must complete but cannot interfere with user access. This enables the system to gather data continuously without downtime.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by monitoring a complete 30-minute collection cycle while simultaneously making API requests. Collection should complete with all posts/comments saved, and all API requests should succeed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a collection cycle is initiated, **When** the cycle runs for 30 minutes across 14 subreddits, **Then** all data is collected and saved without blocking any API requests
2. **Given** collection encounters a slow Reddit API response, **When** the delay occurs, **Then** other API endpoints remain responsive and do not wait for Reddit
3. **Given** collection processes 700+ posts with 4000+ comments, **When** sentiment analysis runs on each item, **Then** the process completes without causing request timeouts

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

### User Story 3 - System Startup Completes Quickly (Priority: P3)

As a developer or system administrator, I need the application to start and become available within 10 seconds, even if data collection is scheduled to run immediately, so that deployments and restarts don't cause extended downtime.

**Why this priority**: Important for deployment and restart scenarios. Users should not experience long wait times when the system restarts.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting the application and verifying the health endpoint responds within 10 seconds, even with initial collection scheduled.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is starting with an immediate collection scheduled, **When** startup sequence runs, **Then** the health endpoint responds within 10 seconds
2. **Given** the application just started, **When** initial data collection begins, **Then** all API endpoints remain accessible and responsive
3. **Given** a deployment or restart occurs, **When** the system initializes, **Then** users can access the dashboard within 15 seconds

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Reddit API is slow or unresponsive during collection? System should continue serving other requests without degradation
- How does the system handle collection errors (rate limits, network failures) while maintaining API responsiveness? Should gracefully fail and retry without blocking
- What happens when multiple collection cycles are triggered simultaneously? System should queue or reject duplicate requests while maintaining performance
- How does the system behave under high concurrent load (100+ simultaneous API requests) during active collection? Should maintain sub-3-second response times

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST execute Reddit data collection operations without blocking HTTP request handling
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain API response times under 3 seconds during active data collection
- **FR-003**: System MUST complete data collection cycles for all configured subreddits without interrupting service availability
- **FR-004**: System MUST process Reddit posts and comments asynchronously from API request handling
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow the application to start and serve requests within 10 seconds, even when data collection is scheduled immediately
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle concurrent API requests without queueing or delays caused by collection operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST log collection progress and errors without impacting API performance
- **FR-008**: System MUST gracefully handle Reddit API timeouts and rate limits without freezing the application
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain existing collection functionality (30-minute intervals, 14 subreddits, 50 posts per subreddit, 20 comments per post)
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve data integrity - all collected posts, comments, and sentiment scores must be saved correctly

### Key Entities

- **Data Collection Job**: Represents a background task that fetches Reddit data asynchronously, tracks progress (posts collected, comments collected, subreddits processed, errors), and runs independently of HTTP request handling
- **API Request**: User-initiated request for data or system status, must complete within acceptable timeframes regardless of collection status
- **Collection Cycle**: A scheduled iteration of data gathering across all configured subreddits, operates asynchronously with defined intervals

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: API health endpoint responds within 1 second, 100% of the time, regardless of collection status
- **SC-002**: Dashboard loads and displays data within 3 seconds during active data collection
- **SC-003**: Data collection completes for all 14 subreddits (700+ posts, 4000+ comments) without causing any API request to timeout
- **SC-004**: Application startup completes and serves requests within 10 seconds
- **SC-005**: System handles 50 concurrent API requests with average response time under 2 seconds, even during active collection
- **SC-006**: Zero HTTP 500 errors or timeout failures caused by Reddit data collection blocking
- **SC-007**: Collection success rate remains at 100% (0 errors) while maintaining API responsiveness
