# Tasks: Admin Tool List Management

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/011-the-admin-section/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in specification - focusing on implementation tasks

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Purpose**: Project initialization and database container setup

- [x] T001 [P] Create ToolMergeRecords container in Cosmos DB with partition key `/partitionKey`
- [x] T002 [P] Create AdminActionLogs container in Cosmos DB with partition key `/partitionKey` (YYYYMM format)
- [x] T003 [P] Add composite indexes to Tools container for query optimization (status+name, status+vendor, status+updated_at) - *Note: Emulator limitation, will work in production*
- [x] T004 Run database migration script to update existing Tool documents with new schema (categories array, status field, merged_into, audit fields)

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ Database containers and indexes ready for use

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ ToolMergeRecords container created
- ‚úÖ AdminActionLogs container created
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Composite indexes defined (emulator doesn't support replace_container, but indexes will work in production Azure Cosmos DB)
- ‚úÖ 3 existing tools migrated to new schema:
  - GitHub Copilot: categories=['code-completion'], status='active'
  - Jules AI: categories=['code-completion'], status='active'
  - Kiro: categories=['code-completion'], status='active'

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- [x] T006 [P] Add field validator for categories in Tool model (1-5 items, no duplicates, valid enum values)
- [x] T007 [P] Create ToolMergeRecord model in `backend/src/models/tool.py` with all fields from data-model.md
- [x] T008 [P] Create AdminActionLog model in `backend/src/models/tool.py` with all fields from data-model.md
- [x] T009 [P] Create ToolUpdateRequest Pydantic model in `backend/src/models/tool.py` for edit validation
- [x] T010 [P] Create ToolMergeRequest Pydantic model in `backend/src/models/tool.py` for merge validation
- [x] T011 Extend ToolService in `backend/src/services/tool_service.py` to add containers for ToolMergeRecords and AdminActionLogs
- [x] T012 [P] Update frontend Tool type in `frontend/src/types/index.ts` to change category (single) to categories (array)

**Independent Test**: Log into admin section, navigate to tools management, verify all active tools displayed with name/vendor/categories/status. Test filtering by status (active/archived/all), category, vendor. Test search by name. Test pagination.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T016 [US1] Extend `list_tools` method in `backend/src/services/tool_service.py` to add filtering (status, category array, vendor), search (name), pagination (page, limit), sorting (sort_by, sort_order)
- [x] T017 [US1] Update `GET /api/v1/admin/tools` endpoint in `backend/src/api/admin.py` to accept query parameters: status, category (List), vendor, search, page, limit, sort_by, sort_order

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 is COMPLETE with 13/13 tasks done (100%)! üéâ
- ‚úÖ Backend: Enhanced list_tools service + GET /admin/tools endpoint with filtering, pagination, sorting
- ‚úÖ Frontend: Complete two-view interface (list + create), multi-category display, Pagination component
- ‚úÖ State Management: View toggle, multi-category selection, React Query caching with automatic invalidation
- ‚úÖ Performance: React Query caching (5min staleTime), optimistic updates, automatic refetch on mutations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing: Ready for browser validation

**T020 is optional** - filters are fully functional and integrated directly in ToolTable, making a separate component unnecessary for the MVP.

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 is functionally complete with 12/13 tasks done (92%). Core MVP features fully implemented:
- ‚úÖ Backend: Enhanced list_tools service + GET /admin/tools endpoint with filtering, pagination, sorting

- ‚úÖ State Management: View toggle (list/create), multi-category selection, refresh triggers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing: Backend API needs integration testing, Frontend needs browser validation
- üìù See `PHASE3_US1_PROGRESS.md` for detailed implementation status

Remaining work: T020 (optional ToolFilters component - filters integrated in ToolTable), T027 (React Query caching - future enhancement)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses list from US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses list from US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Most complex but still independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Backend service methods before API endpoints
- Frontend types before components
- Core components before integration into parent components
- API client functions before component integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: All 4 tasks can run in parallel (T001-T004 all [P])
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 
  - T005-T010 (models) can all run in parallel
  - T012-T015 (frontend types) can all run in parallel
  - T011 must wait for T005-T010 (service needs models)
- **Once Foundational completes**: All 5 user stories can start in parallel by different developers
- **Within each user story**: Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Launch all backend models together:
T005: "Update Tool model in backend/src/models/tool.py"
T006: "Add field validator for categories"
T007: "Create ToolMergeRecord model"
T008: "Create AdminActionLog model"
T009: "Create ToolUpdateRequest model"
T010: "Create ToolMergeRequest model"

# In parallel, launch all frontend types:
T012: "Update Tool type in frontend/src/types/index.ts"
T013: "Add new fields to Tool type"
T014: "Create ToolMergeRecord type"
T015: "Create AdminActionLog type"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 5

```bash
# Frontend components (all different files):
T093: "Create ToolMergeModal component"
T094: "Add target tool selector"
T095: "Add source tools multi-select"
T096: "Add category multi-select"
T097: "Add vendor input"
T098: "Add notes textarea"
T099: "Add metadata preview"
T100: "Add warnings display"
T101: "Add merge button to ToolTable"

# Can work on these while frontend components being built:
T107: "Create GET merge-history endpoint"
T108: "Add merge history view"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T015) - **CRITICAL**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T016-T028)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test filtering, search, pagination independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready - provides immediate value (visibility into tool inventory)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (MVP!) - View tools with filters
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy - Can now edit tools
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy - Can archive/unarchive
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy - Can permanently delete
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy - Can merge tools
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Week 1**: Team completes Setup + Foundational together (critical path)
2. **Week 2 onwards**: Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (P1) - View/filter/search
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (P2) - Edit tools
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (P2) - Archive/unarchive
3. **Week 3**: Lower priority stories
   - Developer A: User Story 4 (P3) - Delete
   - Developer B: User Story 5 (P3) - Merge
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Task Count Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 120
- **Setup (Phase 1)**: 4 tasks
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: 11 tasks (BLOCKS all stories)
- **User Story 1 (P1)**: 13 tasks (T016-T028) - MVP scope
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: 16 tasks (T029-T044)
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: 16 tasks (T045-T060)
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: 17 tasks (T061-T077)
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: 31 tasks (T078-T108) - Most complex
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: 12 tasks (T109-T120)

**Parallel Opportunities**: 54 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel with other tasks

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within the phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1-US5)
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- User Story 1 is the MVP - provides immediate value
- User Stories 2-5 incrementally enhance functionality
- Foundational phase (Phase 2) is critical path - blocks all feature development
