# Feature Specification: Admin Tool List Management

**Feature Branch**: `011-the-admin-section`  
**Created**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The Admin section should contain all active tools as a list. This should allow the ability to delete or archive tools that are no longer relevant, modify names of existing tools, merge tools (in case of a acquisition), in addition to the ability to add tools that was previously implemented."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View All Active Tools (Priority: P1)

Administrators need to see a comprehensive list of all tools currently tracked in the system to understand what tools are being monitored and their current status.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability - administrators cannot perform any management actions without first being able to view the tools. This provides immediate value by giving visibility into the tool inventory.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging into the admin section and verifying that all active tools are displayed in a list format with key information (name, vendor, category, status).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an administrator is logged into the admin section, **When** they navigate to the tools management page, **Then** they see a complete list of all active tools
2. **Given** the tools list is displayed, **When** the administrator views each tool entry, **Then** they can see the tool name, vendor, category, and current status
3. **Given** there are archived tools in the system, **When** the administrator views the active tools list, **Then** archived tools are not displayed in the default view

---

### User Story 2 - Modify Tool Information (Priority: P2)

Administrators need to update tool information when details change, such as when a tool is rebranded, changes ownership, or needs corrected information.

**Why this priority**: After viewing tools, the ability to maintain accurate information is critical for data quality. This enables administrators to keep the tool database current without requiring developer intervention.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting an existing tool, modifying its name or vendor information, saving the changes, and verifying the updated information is displayed and persisted.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an administrator is viewing the tools list, **When** they select a tool to edit, **Then** a form appears with the current tool information (name, vendor, category, description)
2. **Given** the edit form is displayed, **When** the administrator modifies the tool name and saves, **Then** the updated name is reflected in the tools list immediately
3. **Given** a tool's vendor has changed, **When** the administrator updates the vendor field and saves, **Then** the new vendor information is stored and displayed
4. **Given** invalid data is entered (e.g., empty name), **When** the administrator attempts to save, **Then** validation errors are shown and changes are not saved

---

### User Story 3 - Archive Inactive Tools (Priority: P2)

Administrators need to archive tools that are no longer relevant or actively used, removing them from the active list while preserving historical data.

**Why this priority**: Maintaining a clean, relevant tool list is essential for usability and accurate analytics. Archiving (vs. deleting) preserves historical sentiment data while decluttering the active view.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by archiving a tool, verifying it no longer appears in the active tools list, confirming historical sentiment data is preserved, and optionally viewing archived tools in a separate view.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an administrator is viewing the tools list, **When** they select the archive action for a tool, **Then** a confirmation dialog appears warning about the impact
2. **Given** the administrator confirms the archive action, **When** the tool is archived, **Then** it is removed from the active tools list but historical sentiment data remains accessible
3. **Given** a tool has been archived, **When** the administrator views archived tools, **Then** the archived tool appears in the archived tools list
4. **Given** an archived tool, **When** the administrator chooses to unarchive it, **Then** the tool returns to the active tools list

---

### User Story 4 - Delete Tools Permanently (Priority: P3)

Administrators need to permanently remove tools that were added in error or are no longer needed, including all associated data.

**Why this priority**: While less common than archiving, permanent deletion is necessary for data cleanup (e.g., test data, duplicate entries). This is lower priority because archiving handles most use cases.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deleting a tool, confirming it no longer appears in any list (active or archived), and verifying associated sentiment data is also removed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an administrator is viewing a tool (active or archived), **When** they select the delete action, **Then** a strong confirmation dialog appears warning about permanent data loss
2. **Given** the administrator confirms the deletion, **When** the tool is deleted, **Then** it is permanently removed from the system along with all associated sentiment data
3. **Given** a tool has associated sentiment data, **When** the administrator attempts to delete it, **Then** the confirmation dialog displays the amount of data that will be lost
4. **Given** a tool is deleted, **When** historical reports are generated, **Then** the deleted tool's data is no longer included

---

### User Story 5 - Merge Tools (Priority: P3)

Administrators need to merge two or more tools into a single tool when duplicates exist or when companies acquire other companies and consolidate their tools.

**Why this priority**: While important for data integrity in acquisition scenarios, tool mergers are infrequent events. This is lower priority but provides significant value when needed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting two tools, initiating a merge operation, choosing which tool becomes the primary, and verifying that sentiment data from both tools is consolidated under the primary tool.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an administrator identifies duplicate tools or acquisition-related tools, **When** they initiate a merge operation, **Then** they can select a primary tool and one or more secondary tools to merge
2. **Given** the merge is initiated, **When** the administrator confirms the operation, **Then** all sentiment data from secondary tools is transferred to the primary tool
3. **Given** tools are merged, **When** the merge completes, **Then** the secondary tools are archived (not deleted) and marked as merged into the primary tool
4. **Given** a merge operation, **When** the administrator views the primary tool's data, **Then** the combined sentiment history from all merged tools is visible with source attribution
5. **Given** tools have different categories or vendors, **When** merging, **Then** the system displays a validation warning showing the metadata differences and allows the administrator to proceed after reviewing
6. **Given** merged tools have different categories, **When** the administrator completes the merge, **Then** they can select multiple categories for the resulting tool (e.g., "code completion" and "autonomous coding agent" after an acquisition)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an administrator tries to archive or delete a tool that is currently being referenced in an active sentiment analysis job?
- How does the system handle merging tools with conflicting information (different categories, vendors, or aliases)?
- What occurs if an administrator attempts to modify a tool name to match an existing tool name?
- How does the system prevent accidental deletion or archiving through concurrent administrator actions?
- What happens to tool aliases when a tool is archived, deleted, or merged?
- How does the system handle filtering and search when a tool has multiple categories?
- What is the maximum number of categories a tool can have?

- **Tool Merge Record**: Represents the relationship between tools that have been merged. Key attributes include source tool(s), target/primary tool, merge date, administrator who performed merge, category/vendor changes during merge, and reason/notes.
- **Administrative Action Log**: Represents audit trail of all administrative actions performed on tools. Key attributes include action type, tool identifier, administrator identity, timestamp, before/after state, and action reason/notes.
