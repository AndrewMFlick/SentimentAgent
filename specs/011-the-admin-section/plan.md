# Implementation Plan: Admin Tool List Management

**Branch**: `011-the-admin-section` | **Date**: October 21, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/011-the-admin-section/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature extends the existing admin tool management system to provide comprehensive tool list management capabilities. Administrators will be able to view all active tools, edit tool information, archive/unarchive tools, permanently delete tools, and merge tools (e.g., during acquisitions). The system will support multi-category tools and provide validation warnings during merge operations when metadata differs. All administrative actions will be logged for audit purposes.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13.3 (backend), TypeScript 5.3.3 (frontend)
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI 0.109.2, Azure Cosmos SDK 4.5.1, React 18.2.0, TailwindCSS 3.4+, Pydantic 2.x
**Storage**: Azure Cosmos DB (SQL API) - Tools and ToolAliases containers already exist
**Testing**: pytest 8.0.0 (backend), Vitest (frontend), React Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Web application (backend: Linux server, frontend: modern browsers)
**Project Type**: Web application (separate backend/frontend)
**Performance Goals**: 
  - Tool list loads in <3 seconds for 500+ tools
  - Edit/save operations complete in <30 seconds
  - Merge operations complete in <60 seconds for 10k sentiment data points
  - Search results return in <5 seconds
**Constraints**: 
  - Must maintain backward compatibility with existing tool management APIs
  - Cannot break existing sentiment analysis functionality
  - Must preserve all historical sentiment data during archive/merge operations
  - Admin authentication required (existing placeholder system)
**Scale/Scope**: 
  - Support 500+ tools in system
  - Handle up to 10,000 sentiment data points per tool
  - Multi-category support (up to 5 categories per tool - resolved via research)
  - Concurrent administrator access with conflict prevention

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Initial Check** (Before Phase 0): ✅ PASS - No constitution file found in project. Proceeding with standard best practices.

**Post-Design Check** (After Phase 1): ✅ PASS - Design maintains consistency with existing architecture patterns.

**Notes**: 
- The project does not have a formal constitution file (template placeholder only)
- Will follow existing project patterns from copilot-instructions.md
- Will maintain consistency with Feature 010 (admin tool management) implementation patterns
- Phase 1 design completed - data model, API contracts, and quickstart guide created
- All technical clarifications resolved in research phase
- Agent context updated with new technologies

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure (Option 2) - extending existing backend/frontend separation. This feature builds on top of Feature 010's admin tool management foundation, adding comprehensive CRUD operations and multi-category support.

## Complexity Tracking

**Status**: N/A - No constitution violations to justify.

This feature extends existing architecture patterns without introducing new complexity.
