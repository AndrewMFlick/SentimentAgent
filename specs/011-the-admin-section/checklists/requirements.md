# Specification Quality Checklist: Admin Tool List Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 21, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Resolution Applied**:

- User Story 5, Scenario 5: Resolved - System will allow merge with validation warnings (Option C). When tools have different categories/vendors, the system displays differences and requires administrator review before proceeding. Multi-category support added - tools can have multiple categories (e.g., "code completion" + "autonomous coding agent" after acquisition).

**Overall Assessment**: âœ… Specification is complete and ready for planning. All quality criteria met. No clarifications remain.
